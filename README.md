# Machine Learning

Java collection that provides Java packages for developing a machine learning algorithm and that is
- easy to use -> great for small projects or just to learn how machine learning works
- small and simple -> easy to understand and making changes
- lightweight (mostly because I'm a student who just started to learn how to code Java and can't code more complex :P)

## Code Example

### [Neural Network](src/main/java/neural)

If you have some test data consisting of inputs and outputs.
(Be sure that your data is normalized if needed!)

```
Matrix inputs = new Matrix(
        new double[][]{
          {1, 2},                   //<- first input set
          {3, 4}});                 //<- second input set
Matrix outputs = new Matrix(
        new double[][]{
          {0.5},                    //<- first output set
          {0.75}});                 //<- second output set
```

Initialize a new network with a given architecture (number or inputs, their number of neurons in the hidden layers and each layers activation function)
(If you don't know what to choose, here is a rule of thumb for a quadratic looking network: 
- number of hidden layers = number of inputs
- number of neurons per layer: number of inputs (except the last layer is the output layer = as many neurons as outputs)
- activation functions: hyperbolic tangent)

```
Network net = new Network(
        2,                          //2 inputs
        new int[]{3, 8, 1},         //3 layers with 2, 8 and 1 neurons
        new Network.ActivationFunction[]{   //1 activation function
          Network.ActivationFunction.NONE,  //for every layer
          Network.ActivationFunction.TANH,
          Network.ActivationFunction.NONE});
```

Then you can seed the weights in the network = randomize it.

```
net.seedWeights(-1, 1);
```

Now your network is ready for training!
Just say it how drastic the changes should be, how often it should go through a training cycle, the training data of course and if it should print it's progress to the console.
* learning rate: higher = faster training but to high could miss the optimum, slower = better result (sometimer it goes crazy and the cost just increase, then try decreasing the laerning rate)
* iterations: how often it should cycle through the training process (backpropagation and application)
* inputs: training sets inputs
* outputs: wanted outputs the network should imitate
* printToConsole: show the progress in the console


```
net.train(0.001, 40, inputs, outputs, true);
```

Now the network should be trained so let's have a look at the network itself by simply printing a basic representation and try forwarding the inputs.

```
System.out.println(net);
System.out.println(net.forward(inputs));
```

And if we would like to get the mean squared error we just call the cost function on some test data:

```
System.out.println(net.cost(inputs, outputs));
```

## Installation

I included all packages with the source files in the [Source folder /src](src).
Just add them to your project and you are ready to go!

## Tests

In every Java class should be a main method that shows how to use this specific class.

Both make awesome YouTube videos that explain how machine learning works.
